\subsection*{Introduction}

Riding motorbikes means quite a lot to many people, be it a hobby, mode of transport or a profession. Perfecting and improving certain aspects of riding can be quite trivial at times without statistical analysis.

The aim of this project is to aid in this area by developing an affordable device/system that can log important factors related to the rider performance such as location, movement and more. This device is akin to the concept of a telematics, better known as a ‘black boxes’ in cars.

\subsection*{Deliverables}

As mentioned briefly this system consists of two separate pieces of code, the logging device and the front-\/end application. This can be seen within the folder named \textquotesingle{}motorbikestatistics\textquotesingle{} included within the submission or via remote version control at\+: \href{https://github.com/JackAllister/motorbikestatistics/}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/\+Jack\+Allister/motorbikestatistics/}

Code relating to the logging device is within the folder named \textquotesingle{}logging-\/device\textquotesingle{} Code relating to the front-\/end application in within the folder named \textquotesingle{}android-\/app\textquotesingle{}

\subsubsection*{Front-\/end application}

Installation of Android Studio is required to effectively view code relating to the front-\/end application. However if this is not possible the files can be viewed within your favourite development environment.

\subparagraph*{Locations of front-\/end files are as follows\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Main Code Java Classes} -\/ android-\/app\textbackslash{}
\item {\bfseries Unit Tests} -\/ android-\/app\textbackslash{}
\item {\bfseries Instrumentation Tests} -\/ android-\/app\textbackslash{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Logging device}

Installation of Arduino I\+DE is again required to view, edit and compile logging device code. However once again if this is not possible browsing of code can be done using your favourite development environment.

\subparagraph*{Locations of front-\/end files are as follows\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Logging Device Main Code} -\/ logging-\/device\textbackslash{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subparagraph*{Final logging device uses the following hardware\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Arduino 101
\item Spark\+Fun G\+P\+S-\/13750
\item H\+C-\/06 Bluetooth Module 
\end{DoxyItemize}
